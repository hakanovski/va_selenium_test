# Java Selenium Automation Project

## Introduction
This document provides a comprehensive guide on setting up and executing a Java-based Selenium Automation Project. The purpose of this project is to automate web browsing actions on the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs website for testing purposes, ensuring all navigational elements function as expected.

## Pre-requisites
To run this project, you will need the following environment and tools set up on your machine:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Java SE Development Kit 11 or higher installed and configured. [Oracle JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html)
- **Java Runtime Environment (JRE)**: To execute Java applications, included in the JDK.
- **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**: IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse with Maven support.
- **Maven**: A software project management tool for managing project builds and dependencies. [Apache Maven Project](https://maven.apache.org/)
- **Selenium WebDriver**: An open-source web automation tool. [Selenium HQ](https://www.selenium.dev/)
- **ChromeDriver**: A standalone server that implements WebDriver's wire protocol for Chromium. [ChromeDriver - WebDriver for Chrome](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/)
- **JUnit**: A unit testing framework for Java applications. [JUnit 5](https://junit.org/junit5/)

## Setup
1. **Install JDK**: Download and install the Java Development Kit (JDK) from Oracle's official website. Set the JAVA_HOME environment variable to the JDK installation path.
2. **Install IDE**: Download and install IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse IDE.
3. **Install Maven**: Ensure Maven is installed and configured in your system path.
4. **Install Selenium WebDriver**: Add Selenium WebDriver dependencies to your Maven `pom.xml` file.
5. **Install ChromeDriver**: Download ChromeDriver and set its path in the system environment variables.
6. **Install JUnit**: Add JUnit dependencies to your Maven `pom.xml` file.

## Execution
To execute tests, use the following commands:
```bash
mvn clean install
mvn test

These commands will clean the project, install necessary dependencies, and run the tests defined in the project.

Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

	•	src/main/java: Contains the main Java code for the project.
	•	src/test/java: Contains the Java test code.
	•	pom.xml: Defines project dependencies and Maven plugins.

Project Objective

The objective of this automation project is to streamline the testing process of web applications, reducing manual efforts and improving accuracy in test execution. This particular project is configured to navigate through the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs website, execute specific navigation actions, and validate the functionality of various web elements.

Conclusion

This automation project leverages the power of Java, Selenium WebDriver, and JUnit to perform comprehensive web testing. By automating the browser actions, we ensure that all functionalities work as intended, and any regressions are promptly caught.
