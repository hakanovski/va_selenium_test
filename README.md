# VA.gov Selenium Automation Testing

## Project Overview

This repository contains a set of Selenium scripts written in Python for the purpose of practicing automation testing and gaining familiarity with Selenium's capabilities. The project focuses on automating user interaction scenarios on the VA.gov website, which is the official site for the United States Department of Veterans Affairs.

The test cases aim to automate navigation and functionality verification within the site to ensure that key features are functioning as expected.

## Test Cases

- **Test Case 1**: Automates the process of navigating to the 'Contact Us' section and selecting the 'Call Us' option, then returning to the homepage.
- **Test Case 2**: Focuses on using the 'Find a VA Location' feature by inputting a zip code, selecting a facility type, and searching for locations, followed by a return to the homepage.

## Technologies

- **Selenium WebDriver**: For browser automation.
- **Python**: The scripting language used to write the tests.
- **ChromeDriver**: The web driver for the Chrome browser used to perform test automation.

## Setup and Execution

To run these tests, you will need to have Python installed on your machine along with Selenium and ChromeDriver. Detailed instructions on setting up can be found in the Selenium documentation.

After cloning the repository, you can run the scripts individually to execute the test cases.

## Contributing

Contributions to expand the test coverage or improve the existing scripts are welcome. Please ensure to follow the coding conventions and add comments to your code where necessary.
